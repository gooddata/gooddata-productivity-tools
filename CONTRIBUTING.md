# Contributing
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)):

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed behaviour, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues. If you want to report a bug or propose new feature, [open a new issue]().

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Before creating pull request run `black` and `ruff` on the codebase to ensure consistent style and run `mypy` to check for typing errors.
